To set up a CI/CD pipeline for building a library, you can use a combination of tools and services. Here's a breakdown of the process and what you need to know:

### Tools You Can Use:
1. **Version Control and Repository Hosting:**
   - **GitHub Actions**: Popular and integrates well with GitHub repositories.
   - **GitLab CI/CD**: If you're using GitLab for your repository.
   - **CircleCI**: A third-party option with good integration.
   - **Travis CI**: Another option, particularly popular with open-source projects.
   
2. **Build Tools and Package Management:**
   - **Vite**: Since your library is built with Vite, you'll need to configure the build process using Vite's build system.
   - **npm or yarn**: For managing dependencies and publishing packages.
   - **ESLint/Prettier**: For linting and formatting checks during the CI pipeline.
   - **Jest or Vitest**: For running unit tests on your library.

3. **Testing and Linting:**
   - **Jest or Vitest**: To run unit tests on your components and logic.
   - **ESLint**: To ensure consistent code style and find issues.
   - **Prettier**: For consistent formatting (usually run with ESLint).

4. **Automated Deployment/Publishing:**
   - **npm Publish**: For automating the publishing process to npm.
   - **Semantic Release**: Automates versioning and package publishing based on commit messages.
   - **GitHub Package Registry**: For publishing private or public packages.
   - **Verdaccio**: If you want to set up your own npm registry for internal libraries.

5. **Automated Documentation Generation:**
   - **Storybook**: To auto-generate component documentation.
   - **Typedoc**: For generating API documentation if needed.

### Steps to Implement CI/CD:
1. **Set up Automated Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for your library components.
   - Configure your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on every push and pull request.

2. **Automate Code Quality Checks**:
   - Include linters (ESLint, Prettier) in the pipeline to check code quality.
   - Run these checks during the build process.

3. **Build the Library**:
   - Use Vite's build tools to bundle the library, generating output that can be published.
   - Ensure you're creating the correct formats (ESM, CJS) for compatibility.

4. **Publish the Library**:
   - Automate publishing using npm publish or a service like Semantic Release.
   - Configure access tokens in your CI pipeline to publish the library without manual intervention.

5. **Versioning and Changelog**:
   - Use tools like `semantic-release` to automatically manage versions and changelogs.

### Key Knowledge Areas:
1. **CI/CD Systems**: Understanding how continuous integration and deployment work (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI).
2. **Build Tools**: Familiarity with Vite and npm/yarn.
3. **Automated Testing**: Writing unit tests for components (Jest or Vitest).
4. **Version Control**: Understanding Git and how to integrate it with CI/CD.
5. **Package Publishing**: How npm publishing works and setting up authentication tokens for CI to publish automatically.
6. **Code Quality Tools**: Familiarity with ESLint, Prettier, and other linters.
7. **Versioning**: Understanding semantic versioning (`semver`), which tools like Semantic Release use.

### Example Pipeline (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm test

  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

This pipeline runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It runs linting, builds the project, tests it, and publishes the package if everything passes and it's on the `main` branch.
